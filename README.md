AeroCopy
========

Copy your clipboard between your iOS devices and Macs with iCloud.

AeroCopy uses iCloud's key-value storage to save a small list of data that is synchronized between devices with iCloud. The iOS app copies and saves whatever's in your clipboard whenever you open the app. The Mac app has a button for the same thing. I wanted the app to be really simple, so using iCloud made sense. This way no logins are needed, and so forth.

The reason the app exists is because I needed something to save tweets with links on my commute when I had a lousy Internet connection. After I moved to Turku, I didn't commute as much anymore and didn't really need this app anymore.

This project is essentially abandoned for the previous reason. Another reason is that I had way more interest in the iOS client from the start, and I didn't want to release this app unless the Mac version was top-notch. (which it isn't)

It'd be fun to release the app, but I'd probably need some help finishing the project. Especially with the Mac app. I don't even have an active Mac Developer Program membership anymore.

Have fun.
